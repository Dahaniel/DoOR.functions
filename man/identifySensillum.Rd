\usage{
identifySensillum(recording, responseMatrix = default.val("response.matrix"),
  tag = "Name", min.cor = 0.9, nshow = 10, ret = "plot",
  method = "cor", sub)
}
\arguments{
\item{recording}{data frame; a data frame with the following columns "odorants" containing InChIKeys of the tested odorrant, and one column called "unit1" etc. for each unit, containing responses (or estimates) scaled between 0 and 1 (see examples)}

\item{responseMatrix}{DoOR response matrix; the data to compair against}

\item{tag}{character; the chemical identifier to use in plots, one of \code{colnames(odor)}}

\item{min.cor}{numeric; a minimum correlation value, the function will check wether there is a higher correlation for all units within a single sensillum}

\item{nshow}{numeric; the number of plots to nshow, plot e.g. only the top 10 matches}

\item{ret}{character; wether to return the "plot" or the "dataframe" with the correlations/distances}

\item{method}{character; the method for similarity calculations: correlation ("cor") or Euclidean distances ("dist")}

\item{sub}{character; if you know the class of sensillum you were recording from you can restrict the search to this subset here ("ab", "ac", "at", "pb", "sac")}
}
\value{
either a plot with responses sorted by highest correlations or lowest distances
}
\description{
correlates the result from a SSR recording of several odorants against all DoOR response profiles
}
\examples{
recording <- data.frame(odorants = c(getKey("BEDN", "Code"), getKey("ETAS", "Code"), getKey("carbon dioxide", "Name")), unit1 = c(.9,.1,.1), unit2 = c(0, .1, 1) )
identifySensillum(recording)
identifySensillum(recording, method = "dist", nshow = 5)
